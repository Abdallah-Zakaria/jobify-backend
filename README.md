### Problem Domain

Day by day the unemployment issue became a big problem in the world, although that there are so many platforms that help people find jobs, they are too many to follow and a bit complicated in some way , so our plan is to make an employment hub that combine all jobs from different sources in one place and make this process as much easier as it could be.
