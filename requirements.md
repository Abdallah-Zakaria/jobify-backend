### Vision

Day by day the unemployment issue became a big problem in the world, although that there are so many platforms that help people find jobs, they are too many to follow and a bit complicated in some way , so our plan is to make an employment hub that combine all jobs from different sources in one place and make this process as much easier as it could be.

## Data Flow

When a guest visits the webapp, he/she can search for a job, so when he clicks the search button a get request will send to the server that will get the requested data from that database process it sends it back to the response as a json file.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Security**
We are going to use Oauth system to let users login to our webapp without using a password, even they sign up using a username and password we will encrypt the password before even storing it to the database using libraries like bcrypt, also the using of jwt to send the token between the front end and the server will add another security layer to our webapp.

**Testability**
We will test each function in our app using libraries like jest and supergoose to make sure that our app is working properly under any case scenario, also libraries like eslint will test any syntax errors before the code is pushed to the repo.
